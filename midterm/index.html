            <h2>The "LEGENDARY" Yamaha YZF-R6 </h2>
            <img src="images/r6-img.jpg" alt="Article Image of an 2007 R6" class="r6-article">
            <p>The Yamaha YZF-R6 (2006–2016) is a legendary supersport motorcycle known for its aggressive styling,
                high-revving 599cc inline-four engine, and razor-sharp handling. The 2006 model introduced a lightweight
                aluminum frame, ride-by-wire throttle (YCC-T), and a sky-high redline of 16,500 rpm (later revised). In
                2008, Yamaha added its Chip Controlled Intake (YCC-I) for better top-end power. The R6’s fully
                adjustable suspension, slipper clutch, and aerodynamic design made it a dominant force on the track,
                while its aggressive ergonomics catered to serious riders. Despite incremental updates, its core formula
                remained unchanged, offering precise control and exhilarating performance. The bike featured dual
                radial-mounted front disc brakes for exceptional stopping power and a stiff chassis for enhanced
                stability. Though less practical for street riding, the R6 excelled in its intended role as a race-ready
                machine. By 2016, it had cemented its status as one of the most beloved 600cc sportbikes, offering an
                unmatched balance of speed, agility, and thrilling riding dynamics.
