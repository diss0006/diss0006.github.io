            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            My name is Emith Hansana. This is the 20<sup>th</sup> year since I appeared on Earth. I am currently enrolled in "<em>Interactive Media Design</em>" program in Algonquin College.
             I was born and raised in Yakkala, Sri Lanka. My main three obsessions are Music, Cars and motorcycles, But I also enjoy playing 
             video games with friends and travelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            I aim to build myself a well balanced life. My goal is to make my career out of my passion, and that is to be a music producer.
            Hopefully, Someday I will be the <abbr title="Greatest Of All Time">G.O.A.T</abbr> of the music industry. But Above all, I will make sure that I will stay happy and satisfied 
            with who I am right now, until I will be who I want to be.
        </p>
